<h1>Frayed Knot Nautical Arts
Flemished or Coxcombed Wheels </h1>

<div class="article">

<p>The tradition of coxcombing your helm is an old one... Originally
developed to protect the wood from salt and sun on wooden wheels, it
was continued on the steel wheels commonly found on sailing craft and
the better class of motor vessels found today in pleasure service.

Since these wheels lack the belaying-pin-type protrusions found on
wooden wheels, it also provides a better grip for the hands when at the
helm, especially when encountering a quartering sea.  Anyone who has
had to hang on for dear life to a slippery steel wheel in heavy weather can
attest to the remarkable grip such coxcombing can give.  It is also a
decorative feature which can enhance the appearance of your cockpit and
hark back to the days when sail was a "working" form of transportation.

The wheel used in these pictures is a 15" "destroyer"-style wheel,  not
something you'd usually find on a rag-bag, but much more common on
20-36' powercraft, on which it looks superb!  It's small and easy to
transport and I can change the whipping and combing as required to
either demonstrate something new or I can buy one and leave it at a
marine emporium as a sample without breaking the bank.  (Can't do it
with a 32" or a 40"!  Costs too much!)

The cane is something I whipped up so that I could have a quick was of
demonstrating the five whippings it contains, as well as some of the
common sizes of turksheads available...

I charge $50.00 per hour for these wheels... A 40" can easily run into 18
to 20 hours of work, but smaller wheels are correspondingly faster to do
and so the final charge would be far less.  The number and complexity of
turksheads will also affect the final cost.

You can EMAIL me for further details or to make an appointment for a
work date, or call me at 215-843-7207 to do this or ask questions.  I travel
to do this (East Coast US  mid-Atlantic area, from Manasquan to Cape
Henlopen) but I will travel further if there are several commissions in the
same area or.....   (more information here) </p>

    <td>Here's an eight-bight split turkshead.  This took FOREVER to figure
out (as opposed to the six-bight split which only took a few weeks)
and makes a very pretty cover knot, but it takes about two hours to
make and tighten.... Not practical unless you really want the "WOW!"
factor on your wheel,  big time!  (White lead inserted just to give
some contrast for the foto:  I much prefer my turksheads to be all
one colour.)</td>
    <td>Here's the "Half-Moku" on a tiller arm done in #30
cotton line with two 7-strand turksheads as ends.

This is "as shipped" to customer, a painting
contractor, who will varnish it on-site.</td>
    <td>Six-bight  three pass turkshead which will go
between each segment of rim and also "close
off" the top of the stanchion... This took me a
WEEK to figure out how to do and it was well
worth the time spent.. Makes a nice transition
feature!  The way a wheel should look, IMO.</td>
