        <h1> Frayed Knot Arts </h1> 
             <p><strong> 
                  Welcome to all, and thank you for stopping by to look over
                  my wares.  I have been doing fancy-work on-and-off for
                  over fifty-five years, ever since I was initially taught it by an
                  old sailor who lived quite close to me.  I used the know-
                  ledge through my Navy days and have now taken it up again
                  as a full-time business.  


                  I make belts, lanyards, wheel-coverings, tiller-wraps, hand-rail wraps, bellropes
                  of varying complexity, instrument straps, camera straps,  luggage slings....
                  if you can do it with a piece of  line, I've probably either made it or seen it.  I
                  can do MacNamara's lace and mast skirts, but  they tend to get verrrry
                  expensive due to the great amount of time involved.

                  Scrimshaw is made in the traditional method using needles and graphite
                  (for lampblack is not something one can find about the house these days)
                  and is usually done on bamboo or bone for needlecases, although I will
                  attempt other materials on pre-paid order.  An example is found at the
                  top of this page as well as HERE for some personalized cases.  As I make
                  more of this it will eventually migrate to it's own page(s), provided my
                  hands hold up!

                  Belts are "made-to-length" (although I do keep some standard-length
                  belts on hand) and vary from simple squareknots throughout, to
                  ten-diamond designs,   open and filled diamonds, chevrons and crosses,
                  etc., etc.  Prices run from $120.00  for a small plain belt up through the
                  roof for specialty items.   I also can make suspenders (galluses), one
                  example of which is shown on the knotpics page.  


                  Wheels are coxcombed along the rim of the wheel
                  (aesthetically, I prefer to leave the spokes un-flemished
                  as it produces a 'floating' effect on the rim fancywork,
                  but if you wish, I can also do work on them as well) and
                  can either be done at my location (if you ship me a wheel
                  to work on) or I can travel to your location to do the work.  
                  (See page for details)  

                  WARNING: This AIN'T cheep!

                  I also do stair rails, companionways, or anything that's round and
                  needs flemishing.   It's QUITE pricey but for those who love the
                  look, a definite plus for their vessel or home/workplace.

                  This is a picture of me after doing three flights of stairs for
                  The Joint Strike Fighter people in Maryland.

                  Clicking on the picture will take you to a page all about it.


                  IF YOU HAVE pictures of your work or something you'd like to send
                  for inclusion on the site, please take a moment to read THIS page
                  and send me an email if you have ANY questions at all!


                  Earrings, Necklaces and wristlets are just that: cumshaw* work for those who want to 'knock-'em-dead' at the yacht club  or 
                  marina.  They pack a lotta bang for the buck in that respect.

                  Instrument straps and instrument decoration are a specialty.  Guitar, Mandolin and Autoharp straps are all a min. of 2-1/2 in. wide 
                  and can go to 5 inches, but the price is exponential to size.    Saxophone straps are highly useful and very strong, and they're a 
                  vibrant change from the usual 'black piece of string" that most guys use. (page coming soon)  Turksheads on flutes, etc., are most 
                  impressive.  I also do canes, walking sticks and walking staffs.

                  As long as we're talking about instruments, I played Irish mandolin for many years and have done something rather 
                  special for those who love Irish music but who (like me) cannot READ music: go HERE for information on
                  this project and to acquire a CD of the tunes involved.  I think you'll be impressed!

                  Bellropes and Boatswain's Lanyards are also a speciality.  If you've a certain design you want, just let me know.

                  Professions which use hand tools (Geologists, Archaeologists, Surveyors, Building Trades) can also benefit from having some 
                  fancy-work cast onto the handles or heads of their tools:  They improve your grip and serve to identify your tool immediately, as 
                  well as being a mark of pride.

                  Thanks again for stopping!  Go poke around a bit and I bet you'll find something you like.   If you have any questions on anything 
                  here, please EMAIL me.  Also, if you see any ERRORS on the page (overlapping text, bad links, egregious exhibitions of my stupidity, 
                  mis-spleeings) PLEASE let me know so I can fix it.

                  (Gee... you still here?)  

                  Well, since you are, let me switch hats to my non-commercial one and talk a bit about the LIBRARY section of the site.

                  In there you will find pictures of fancywork and other nautical-type items (mostly handmade) which occupied the time of a great 
                  many sailor-men during the age of sail.  When you were on a whale-ship and looking at four years before you returned to your 
                  home port, and sometimes six months between landfalls, it was next to impossible to stay occupied and sane, especially when you 
                  consider that a whaler carried more men than were necessary to just work the ship, so most men either did scrimshaw with scraps 
                  of whalebone from their harvests or, more rarely, fancy knotwork.  Admittedly, I tend toward the knotwork.       Go visit.

                  There are also pages on Tutorials on making ropework,  pages devoted to just one knottyer's work, pages for knottyers who have 
                  gone on to Fiddler's Green and so forth... it's an interesting place I've got here and you'll never know just what you may find in the orlop!
